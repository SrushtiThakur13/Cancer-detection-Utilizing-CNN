# Histopathologic Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to automate the detection of metastatic cancer in histopathologic scans of lymph nodes. The solution uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch and aims to accurately classify cancerous and non-cancerous tissue patches.
